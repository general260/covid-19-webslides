                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that are common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                               
                                </p>
                                <p>   
                                    Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Wuhan coronavirus is currently thought to be more mild than SARS and MERS and takes longer to develop symptoms. Patients to date have typically experienced a mild cough for a week followed by shortness of breath, 
                                    causing them to visit the hospital, explains Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. 
                                    SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related.

                            <p>"The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats." 
                                said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.   
                            </p>

                                Is there a cure for novel coronavirus? <br> 
                                No. While many patients have recovered from their symptoms, there is no known cure.
                                But the first US study of a drug to treat novel coronavirus in humans is underway at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.
                                That clinical trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the antiviral drug remdesivir in adults diagnosed with coronavirus, the US National Institutes of Health said.
